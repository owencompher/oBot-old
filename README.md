# oBot
oBot is a simple discord bot that I made for use by myself and friends.
It has a few simple call-and-response commands, as well as a
configuration system and a usefull text-to-speech function.

I used to work on it in a private repo, but I wanted to make it public so
people could see my work. Unfortunately, I was dumb and used to have the token
hard-coded so I just made a new repo instead.
